    # 🚗 Vehicle Parking Management System (VPMS) API
    
    This is the **RESTful API** for the Vehicle Parking Management System, designed for managing:
    
    - 🅿️ Parking lots
    - 🚘 Parking spots
    - 👤 Users and roles (admin & normal user)
    - 🚗 Vehicle records

    ## 🌐 Styling and Design Highlights:
    - Clean, responsive Bootstrap 5 layout.
    - Font Awesome icons for better UX.
    - Dark theme with high-contrast highlights.
    - Profile section with circular images.
    - Custom navbar with dynamic content (based on login role).
    - Car loading animation shown on page render.

    ## 📊 Admin Dashboard Features:
    - Real-time stats with summary charts.
    - Admin-only controls: add/update/delete lots and users.
    - Detailed tables with pagination (if applied).
    - Search functionality for vehicles and users.

    ## 🧑‍💻 Authentication Note:
    This API uses **Flask-Login** session-based authentication. 
    - To access the API via Swagger UI, first log in through the main web app.
    - Swagger uses your browser session cookie to make authenticated requests.
    
    ❗ For direct API calls (e.g., via Postman or code), ensure you're authenticated through the login endpoint or have a valid session.
